Analyze and manipulate EEG data using PyEEGLab.

## Introduction

PyEEGLab is a python package developed to define pipeline for EEG preprocessing for a wide range of machine learning tasks. It supports set of datasets out-of-the-box and allow you to adapt your preferred one.

## How it Works

Here is a simple quickstart:

    from pyeeglab import *
    dataset = TUHEEGAbnormalDataset()
    preprocessing = Pipeline([
        CommonChannelSet(),
        LowestFrequency(),
        ToDataframe(),
        AmplitudeNormalizer(),
        DynamicWindow(8),
        ToNumpy()
    ])
    dataset = dataset.set_pipeline(preprocessing).load()
    data, labels = dataset['data'], dataset['labels']

In this example, for each sample in the dataset, a common set of electrodes is selected, then downsampled to the lowest frequency and normalized using a min-max centralized approach. Each sample is then splitted in eight windows or frames.

This approach is quite usefull for tasks like artifact classification or seizure detection.

## How to Install

PyEEGLab is distributed using the pip repository:

    pip install PyEEGLab

If you need a bleeding edge version, you can install it directly from GitHub:

    pip install git+https://github.com/AlessioZanga/PyEEGLab@develop

## Out-Of-The-Box Supported Datasets

The following datasets will work upon downloading:

| Dataset | Size&nbsp;(GB) | Class&nbsp;Distribution | Task | Notes |
|---------|---------------:|:------------------------|------|-------|
| [TUH Abnormal EEG Dataset](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml) | 59.0 GB | 'normal': 1521 <br /> 'abnormal': 1472 | Generic abnormal EEG events vs. normal EEG traces. | This dataset does not contain any annotation, the event extraction is performed according to other papers that used this dataset: for each record a 60s sample is extracted and labelled according to the class of the file. |
| [TUH Artifact EEG Dataset](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml) | 5.5 GB  | 'null': 1940 <br /> 'eyem': 606 <br /> 'musc': 254 <br /> 'elpp': 178 <br /> 'chew': 161 <br /> 'shiv': 60 | Multiple artifacts vs. EEG baseline. | At the moment, only the '01_tcp_ar' EEG reference setup can be used (more than ~95% of total records). |
| [TUH Seizure EEG Dataset](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml) | 54.0 GB | 'fnsz': 4240 <br /> 'gnsz': 1717 <br /> 'cpsz': 1496 <br /> 'tnsz': 334 <br /> 'tcsz': 191 <br /> 'mysz': 6 <br /> 'absz': 2 | Generic unclassified seizure type vs. specific seizure types. | At the moment, only the '01_tcp_ar' EEG reference setup can be used (more than ~95% of total records). <br /> Also, 'bckg' and 'scpz' classes are ignored: the former is just (a lot of) background noise, the latter has just one instance, which cannot be used with stratified cross-validation. |
| [Motor Movement/Imagery EEG Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/) | 3.4 GB | | Motor movement / imagery events. | The size of this dataset will increase a lot during preprocessing: although its download size is fairly small, the records of this dataset are entirely annotated, meaning that the whole dataset is suitable for feature extraction, not just sparse events like the others datasets. |
| [CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/) | 43.0 GB | 'noseizure': 545 <br /> 'seizure': 184 | No seizure events vs. seizure events. | While for 'seizure' events there are (begin, end, label) records, the 'noseizure' class is computed by extracting a 60s sample from records that are flagged as 'noseizure'. |

## How to Get a Dataset

> **WARNING**: Retriving the TUH EEG datasets require valid credentials, you can get your own at: https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/request_access.php.

Given the dataset instance, trigger the download using the "download" method:

    from pyeeglab import *
    dataset = TUHEEGAbnormalDataset()
    dataset.download(user='USER', password='PASSWORD')
    dataset.index()

then index the new downloaded files.

It should be noted that the download mechanism work on Unix-like systems given the following packages:

    sudo apt install sshpass rsync wget
