CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old right handed gentleman with a history of right
subdural hematoma followed by complex partial seizures, also history of intractable
pain.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, gabapentin, Nifedipine, Levetiracetam, HCTZ

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is noted to have a
previous craniotomy site.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm. Superimposed upon this there is an area of focal delta with
arrhythmic mixed theta delta seen in the right to mid to posterior temporal region and
right central parietal region. On rare occasions right temporal sharp waves are noted.
Photic stimulation elicits little in the way of a driving response. Drowsiness is
characterized by an accentuation of the focal slowing, as well as more of a distribution
of the focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant. Hyperventilation seems to
accentuate the focal slowing more in a central temporal or central parietal distribution.

HR: 72bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal and central temporal focal slowing.
2. Rare right temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal slowing is much less prominent than it was
years ago. The sharp waves are in the region of his previous craniotomy. Overall, this
study is unchanged compared to prior.
