CLINICAL HISTORY:  75 year old woman admitted on the 04/04/2012, EEG requested on the 04/06/2012.  The patient well known to our service, history of carotid stenosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and refractory epilepsy.  Admitted on the 04/04/2012 with postictal state and left-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm.  Focal slowing is noted in the right temporal region.  There are some sharp waves noted at T2/T4 and a handful also seen at S7, T3.  The sharp waves on the right are associated with significant low-wave.  This was done on the bedside.  Disruption of faster frequency activity is noted on the right posterior quadrant. Sleep is characterized by significant bilateral slow-wave, more so on the right than the left.
HR:    72 bpm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere particularly occipitotemporal region with disruption of faster frequency activity.
Right anterior temporal amplitude sharp waves and spikes.
Rare left anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with a history of epilepsy, which predates her neurologic complaint, the right-sided sharp waves are ipsilateral to the previous
stroke, the left-sided sharp waves may be related to the pre-existing history of complex partial epilepsy.
